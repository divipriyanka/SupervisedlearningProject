# SupervisedlearningProject

This is part of MS Data Science Course as part of Machine Learning Supervised Learning final project at University of Colorado Boulder.

The notebook consists of EDA and Model prediction results. Used Cross validation to compare the different models and the final model is a RandomForest Model. 

The Project is Heart Disease Prediction and the dataset is sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction .

The code has been deployed in streamlit : https://supervisedlearning-hearthealthprediction.streamlit.app/
